        <h2>What is Pasta Puttanesca?</h2>
        <p id="paragraph">The name Pasta Puttanesca loosely translates to “whore&#39;s pasta.” Why? Because it&#39;s
            delicious and cheap… no, I&#39;m kidding (kinda). The theory is that this simple dish was
            a favorite of people who were so dirt poor that they had to live in (and work) the streets.
            It uses ingredients that were inexpensive and abundant in Italy back in the day, like olives,
            anchovies, pasta, tomatoes and capers. You can read more about the<a href="https://www.italymagazine.com/dual-language/pasta-puttanesca-whats-name">history of pasta puttanesca here.</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            And while those ingredients are all inexpensive today in America, we can still use them
            to make a budget-friendly meal. In true Budget Bytes fashion, the recipe uses the super
            potent ingredients sparingly to pack a flavor punch without driving up the cost too high.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Add the olive oil, onion, garlic, and anchovy
                    filets to a large skillet. Sauté the ingredients over medium heat until the onions
                    are soft and the anchovies have dissolved.

                    alt="Dice and add the ingrediants into the skillet"></li>
                <li>Add the crushed tomatoes to the skillet, along with the basil, crushed red pepper,
                    sliced olives, and capers. Stir to combine, then allow the sauce to come up to a simmer.
                    Once simmering, turn the heat down to low and let the sauce simmer, stirring occasionally,
                    while you cook the pasta.

            </li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Once rapidly boiling, add the spaghetti
                    and continue to boil until the pasta is tender (about 7 minutes). Reserve about 1/2 cup of
                    the starchy pasta water before draining the past in a colander.

                <li>Add the cooked and drained pasta to the puttanesca sauce in the skillet (or if your skillet
                    is not big enough, add them both to the large pot used to cook the pasta, heat turned off).
                    Stir to combine the pasta with the sauce. If the pasta becomes dry, add a splash or two of
                    the reserved pasta water. Serve hot.
